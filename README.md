# Machine Learning Quantum Many-body Systems using Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimation and GPU Acceleration

Much research has been dedicated to developing accurate approximations of large many-body quantum mechanical systems and their ground states. As the number of qubits in a system increases, the number of possible spin states increases exponentially. Thus, it becomes infeasible to classically solve these systems for large N. In this project, we introduce a machine learning algorithm that solves for the ground state energy of an arbitrarily large many-body system by using a neural network as an ansatz to approximate the many-body wavefunction. We implement Neural Autoregressive Density Estimation (NADE) to draw from a distribution of 2^N possible states and perform accelerated optimization by running our ground state search on a graphical processing unit (GPU).
